When a key is provided for access, a hash function converts the key into a hash value, which then directly points to the memory location where the corresponding value is stored. This direct access mechanism allows for very fast lookups, regardless of the dictionary's size, on average.\n",

This worst case primarily occurs due to hash collisions, where multiple keys produce the same hash value.
